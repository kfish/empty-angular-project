- Choice of dependencies:
  - angular
    - Is an FRP-style UI framework for whole-page JS applications.
    - So that we don't have to update our UI automatically.
    - Excellent testing capabilities.
  - coffeescript
    - Is an alternative syntax to Javascript (preprocessor).
  - stylus
    - Is an alternative syntax to CSS (preprocessor).
  - testacular
    - Is a console JS test runner that can connect to the browser.
    - Recommended by angular.
  - bower
    - Is a JS/assets "package manager".
    - So that we don't have to download JS libs and assets like bootstrap by hand or check them into the repo.
  - grunt
    - Is a JS task runner.
    - Everybody uses it. Compiles, minifies, watches for file changes.
- Notes
  - You have that the needed programs (see package.json) are runanble in the $PATH.
    `npm install` will install them into `node_modules`, but you still either have to put those into the $PATH or install them globally yourself.
  - bower components/ are top-level so that both app/ and test/ can use them.
  - A node-based development webserver is included.
  - Read the "Top-level tasks" at the end of the Gruntfile.coffee.
  - Most useful commands:
    - grunt build
    - grunt buildwatch (or just grunt)
    - grunt server
    - grunt test
